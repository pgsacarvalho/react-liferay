## About The App
react-example is simple portlet created to be used along with Liferay portal. As I am fan of Iron Man character in Marvel universe I've set up a simple app to display some of the suits created by Tony.

## Technologies
.`react` and a little `css`. Created the project using `Yeoman`. 

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- change your liferay portal's home dir in `.npmbuildrc`
- run `npm run deploy`
* You have to have a instance of liferay up and running, if you not go to their website to download a trial version: [liferay.com](https://www.liferay.com/)

## Approach
It is a straightforward react app created using `yo liferay-js`. Then a simple component to control the toggle when the user clicks in one of the suits. The suit list is hardcoded as it was not the purpose of the project to show how to fetch data from a database/API.
